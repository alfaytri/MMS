## Project Identity

**Project:** MMS — Maintenance Management System
**Owner:** Mohamed Ismail
**Working dir:** `D:/MMS`
**Goal:** Web ERP for a Qatar maintenance company (Alfaytri Maintenance, RSH Cleaning and Pest Control)

---

## Confirmed Tech Stack (DO NOT CHANGE)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |
| Database | Supabase — **same existing project**, 120 tables, 400k rows |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (existing, RLS already configured) |
| Data fetching | TanStack Query v5 |
| Deployment | Vercel |

**Critical DB facts:**
- `profiles` links to auth via `auth_user_id` (NOT `id`)
- `divisions` has: `id`, `name`, `short_name`, `color`, `is_active`, `sort_order`
- Schema reference: `Old Schema/` folder (16 .md files + `schema (1).sql`)
- Index of all 120 tables: `Old Schema/00_index.md`

---

## Design System (DO NOT CHANGE)

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Primary (buttons, active nav) | Orange `#F97316` → HSL `25 95% 53%` |
| Secondary (links, badges) | Blue `#3B82F6` → HSL `217 91% 60%` |
| Background | White `#FFFFFF` |
| Surface | `#F8FAFC` (slate-50) |
| Border | `#E2E8F0` (slate-200) |
| Text primary | `#0F172A` (slate-900) |
| Text muted | `#64748B` (slate-500) |
| Success | `#22C55E` (green-500) |
| Destructive | `#EF4444` (red-500) |
| Warning | `#EAB308` (yellow-500) |

Top nav: white bg, orange active underline. Primary buttons: orange fill, white text.

## Navigation (LOCKED)

```
Top Nav: Logo | Master Data▾ | Orders▾ | Contracts▾ | Invoices▾ | Purchase & Sales▾ | Teams▾ | [User▾]

Master Data▾ (active items):
  Companies & Divisions → /master-data/companies
  Warehouses            → /master-data/warehouses
  Inventory Items       → /master-data/inventory
  Suppliers             → /master-data/suppliers
  Users & Roles         → /master-data/users
  Audit Trail           → /master-data/audit-trail
  Admin                 → /master-data/admin
  --- separator ---
  Service List          [Coming Soon]
  Team & Employee       [Coming Soon]
  Subscription Packages [Coming Soon]
  QuickBooks            [Coming Soon]
  Notification Trail    [Coming Soon]

Orders / Contracts / Invoices / Teams → single "Coming Soon" row, no sub-items

Purchase & Sales▾:
  PURCHASE: Purchase Orders | Approvals | Shipments | Landed Costs | Dead Stock Report | Warehouses

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1 — Target: 1–1.5 months (CURRENT)
**Modules:** Master Data (partial) + Purchase (full) + Sales (full)
**Everything else:** Coming Soon

### Phase 2 — after Phase 1
Orders, Contracts, Invoices & Payments, Teams
(Outsource candidates: Orders, Contracts, Invoices, Teams — all fully specced in `Ideas/`)

### Phase 3
Contact Center (never outsource — too complex)

## ✅ Completed

- [2026-04-16] Full brainstorming & design session
- [2026-04-16] Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-16-mms-phase1-design.md`
- [2026-04-16] Foundation plan written: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-16-mms-foundation.md` (18 tasks)

  - Dashboard with DivisionFilter + 4 stat cards
- [2026-04-16] **Bug fixes** — Base UI dropdown context errors resolved
  - `NavDropdown.tsx`: wrapped each group in `<DropdownMenuGroup>` so `DropdownMenuLabel` has required `MenuGroupRootContext`

  - All nav dropdowns (Purchase & Sales, Master Data) and avatar menu now work correctly
- [2026-04-16] **Git setup** — remote connected to `https://github.com/alfaytri/MMS.git`, foundation pushed to `main`, active development on branch `develop`

## HOW TO RESUME IN A NEW SESSION

Paste this file and say:
> "I'm continuing MMS development. Read PROGRESS.md and resume from where we left off."

Claude will read the plan file for the current In Progress item and dispatch subagents task by task.

**Active branch:** `develop` (all Phase 1 feature work goes here — never commit directly to `main`)
